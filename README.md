# Identify-and-Remove-Suspicious-Browser-Extensions

This task involved identifying and removing suspicious or unnecessary browser extensions to improve overall browser security. I reviewed installed extensions for excessive permissions, researched their reputation and developer trustworthiness, and removed any that posed potential privacy or security risks. The objective was to raise awareness about browser-based threats, such as malicious add-ons or data harvesters, and to implement proactive extension hygiene for safer browsing.

üîç Key Activities:
Audited browser extensions for permissions like access to browsing history, clipboard, and file systems

Researched extension ratings, reviews, and publisher legitimacy

Identified extensions with obfuscated or suspicious behavior

Educated users on managing extensions and minimizing unnecessary add-ons

üõ°Ô∏è Outcome:
Enhanced browser security posture, reduced exposure to malicious extensions, and improved user understanding of browser-based attack vectors.
